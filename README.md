# Credit card validator

An absolutely real and secure credit card validator that will surely not be saved into a public JSON file.


## Demo of the credit card validator

Maybe I will someday add a gif or an image showing what it looks like if you don't feel like running it locally.



## FAQ

#### Is this credit card validator secure ?
Absolutely not ! I will be storing everyone's credit card information in the public folder ðŸ˜€


#### What happens if my credit card is not valid ?

We simply unfortunately won't be able to use it to buy anything we want. Which is sad ðŸ˜“. So please make sure you are using real credit card information so we can use all of your money.

#### What will we do with your information? 
We will use it to make fraudulent purchases, as well as order a box of 1000 baby frogs to your address.

#### Are we held responsible for credit card theft ?
 
We would actually prefer not to be held responsable, so please be nice and accept to take responsability you theft.



## Run Locally

First of all make sure you have webstorm or any JetBrains product with the new UI activiated and with the One Dark theme, otherwise, I will be sad.

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jajanel/credit_card_validator/tree/master
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the web application locally and open the project

```bash
  npm run dev
```

You can then open the link with any other web browser than Microsoft Edge (not because it would not work: obviously it would work, it only would hurt my feelings if you do)
